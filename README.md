# Rasa NLU Training Data
These Rasa NLU training data examples of small talk are a compilation of some of the chaotic ways in which users interact with chatbots.
This data will hopefully make your chatbot robust in detecting common intents.

# Intents
* greet
* goodbye
* affirm
* deny
* bot_challenge

# Acknowledgments
* The professor who grilled my team during our Rasa chatbot project presentation by using modern small talk lingo on which our project failed
